# Django Backend for React Frontend

This repository contains the Django backend for a web application with a separate React frontend. The backend provides the necessary API endpoints for user authentication and manages user sessions, while the frontend handles the user interface and interaction with the backend APIs.

## Features

- User Registration: Allow users to sign up for a new account with a unique username and password.
- User Login: Existing users can log in using their credentials to access protected resources.
- Token-based Authentication: The backend uses token-based authentication to secure API endpoints and manage user sessions.

## Technologies Used

- Django: A powerful and popular web framework for building backend applications using Python.
- Django REST framework: An extension for Django that simplifies building RESTful APIs.
